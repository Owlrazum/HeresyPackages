# MarchingCubes

## Desciption

Was implemented in *ColorConquer g-158*.

The example is the script generating blobs using two additional jobs that initialize scalar field.
For proper work, scalar field should be initialized.

Was made thanks to:
https://github.com/Eldemarkki/Marching-Cubes-Terrain

In case I return to it, should declare public API for adhering to semantic versioning.

## Possible improvements

- Work under refactoring.
- Create scalarFieldCell, to incorportate position and value.
