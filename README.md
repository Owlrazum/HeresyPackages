# Orazum heresy.

The packages here are not included in the base template. For not supporting the main religion of accessibility, they were entitled heretics. (This is what history tells)

Nevertheless, anyone can offer a home for such people, because in our world there are no refugees.
Their legacy will not be forgotten.

Come, say hello and ask them what they have to offer (￢‿￢ )

Here they are:

 - MarchingCubes
 - Grid
 - MeshCut

## MarchingCubes

The youngest of these people, has something to show you:

## Grid

The oldest of these people. It does not want to show something, it is unnecessary to him.

## MeshCut

The most middle and silent of these people. Lacks attention.
